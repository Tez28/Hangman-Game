        This is a game of Hangman. Players will be given a randomly generated word. The 
        player will be given 7 chances to guess the correct letter from the letter buttons 
        below the word box. Each correct letter will be placed on the screen, each wrong
        letter the player will be given a red X. If the player guesses the word correctly
        they will be given another word. If the player receives 7 red X's in a row the game
        is over and the player will be given a final score to be logged.
